What is GitHub ?
- Github is a web-based GUI repository hosting service that provides “access control and many collaboration features” (Techcrunch).


When was is created ? Why ? By who ? 
- Github was founded in 2008. It was created to “host open-source software projects” (Wikipedia). In addition, it was created with the idea of strengthening collaborative practices between programmers. The platform was developed by Chris Wanstrath PJ Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails. It was later acquired by Microsoft on June 4th, 2018. 

What similar platforms exist ?
-Bitbucket
SourceForge
GitLab
CodePlex


Why would you use such a platform ?
-To house my source code projects for various reasons:
Employer request that the source code be stored via GitHub 
Personal Use (So it's not lost)
School (Teacher or Professor)
For collaborative reasons: work with a team that edits the source code
Retrieving source code

Repository
Contains all the project files (with the addition of documentation) and stores the file revision history. In addition, they can have multiple collaborators and can be set as public and or private.
Commit
Also known as a revision; is a challenge to a file. When you save a file, Git creates a unique ID (the “SHA” or the “hash”) that helps keep record of who made the changes, what changes were made, and when the changes were made.
Push
In Git, pushing means to send tour commited changes to a remote repository (i.e. one hosted on Github). Once you change something local, you must push those changes in order for others to access them. 
Branch
A branch is to be considered a parallel version of a repository. It exist within the repository but does not affect the master branch; meaning that a programmer can work within the branch without messing with the “live” version of the code. Once the changes have been made, merge your branch back into the master branch to make your changes public. 
Fork
It is defined as a personal copy of another user’s repository that lives on your GitHub account. With fork, one is able make changes to a project without affecting the original.  
Merge
Takes changes from one branch and applies it to another. This can be done by using a pull request, the command line, and manually through the GitHub web GUI.
Clone
It is a copy of a repository that exist on your computer and not on the Github server. There you can make changes to the files using your preferred editor and keep track of the changes via Git. 
Pull
Meaning you are fetching in changes and merging them. This allows your local files to be up to date
Pull request 
A user submits a pull request to propose changes to a repository. These changes can be either rejected or accepted
